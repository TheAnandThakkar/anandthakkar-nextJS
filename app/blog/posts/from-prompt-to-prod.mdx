## My Challenge: Two Real Apps, New Stacks—using AI where it helps

This week I ran an experiment: could I ship two functional apps in frameworks I hadn’t used before?

- ✅ An **iOS app** (SwiftUI)
- ✅ A **web app** (Next.js)

Repos:

- 📱 iOS (SwiftUI): [github.com/TheAnandThakkar/anandthakkar-swiftUI](https://github.com/TheAnandThakkar/anandthakkar-swiftUI)
- 🌐 Web (Next.js): [github.com/TheAnandThakkar/anandthakkar-nextJS](https://github.com/TheAnandThakkar/anandthakkar-nextJS)

I leaned on **generative AI** for scaffolding, translating ideas into code, and producing UI components. It felt close to magic—until the **production boundary** reminded me what still takes engineering craft.

## The Reality Check: Code Generated ≠ Product Deployed

AI is great at producing code. Getting to a **running, reliable, scalable product** still needs a developer.

Even in this small experiment, shipping depended on human judgment:

### 1) The CI/CD Labyrinth

Pipelines, deploy keys, environment variables, and release automation (e.g., GitHub Actions) don’t wire themselves. Shipping is a **process**, not just a commit.

### 2) The Runtime Riddle

When dependency conflicts, production-only bugs, or memory/CPU spikes appear, prompts won’t save you. You need **debugging instincts** and log literacy built through experience.

### 3) The Architectural Blueprint

AI can assemble components; it doesn’t pick the trade-offs. API boundaries, state strategy, scaling plans—**architecture** is about anticipating failure and growth with context.

These are not just coding steps; they’re **engineering decisions**.

## Why Fundamentals Still Win

This worked because I have a base in **software design** (abstraction, OOP, clean code). AI’s output wasn’t copy–paste; it was material to evaluate and refine.

That’s why **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** still matter:

- ⚡ **Performance awareness:** Is this `O(n^2)` when `O(n log n)` exists?
- 🧩 **Right data model:** HashMap vs Tree vs Graph?
- 🚀 **Scalability:** Will this hold at 10k concurrent users?

AI delivers the _what_. Fundamentals give you the _why_.

## Experience: The Unfair Advantage

AI will keep improving. Durable systems still require **context, trade-off thinking, and accountability**.

The developer’s value is shifting from:

> “I can write code quickly”
>
> to
>
> “I can debug, deploy, and design systems that last.”

AI is a phenomenal tool. Tools don’t build enduring systems—**craftspeople do**. The best craftspeople have battled real systems, real bugs, and real deadlines.

**Experience will continue to ship products.**

_What’s been the biggest gap you’ve seen between AI-generated code and real-world deployment? I’d love to hear where your judgment made the difference._
