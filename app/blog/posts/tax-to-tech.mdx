From ledgers to lines of code, my journey has been a story of reinvention. For eight years, from 2012 to 2020, I had the privilege of working in the world of **Taxation and Accounting**. My career began at Sunil B. Thakkar & Co., where I was involved in everything from Income Tax and GST return filings to TDS compliance and appeals. Those years were filled with challenges, leadership opportunities, and constant learning. I remain deeply grateful to my mentor, CA Sunil B. Thakkar, and my colleagues for shaping my foundation with their guidance and support.

During that time, I also founded **Taxaltus™**, a proprietary consultancy firm under the Thakkar & Companies group. The mission was simple yet meaningful—make tax filing transparent and hassle-free for taxpayers, while building trust and clarity with the department.

## The Turning Point

While pursuing the rigorous Chartered Accountant curriculum, I gained in-depth knowledge of Direct Taxes, Indirect Taxes, Finance, and more. Yet, somewhere along the way, I discovered my true passion wasn’t confined to ledgers and tax codes.

I discovered a passion for technology, design, and building products people could interact with every day. So, I made the tough decision to pivot my career to **mobile application development**—a field that excites me, challenges me, and allows me to express my creativity through clean, minimalistic, and user-friendly designs.

## Expanding Into Backend & Cloud

What started as a journey in mobile app development soon expanded into **backend development**. I quickly realized that a great app needs a powerful and scalable engine behind it. That curiosity led me to work with frameworks like **NestJS** and **Spring Boot**, where I learned to design reliable, secure, and high-performing backend systems.

To broaden my skills even further, I explored the cloud ecosystem and successfully cleared the **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** examination in August 2024. This achievement not only validated my knowledge but also empowered me to think about systems holistically—from user experience on the front end, to backend logic, all the way to cloud infrastructure.

## Hometown & Inspiration

I proudly hail from **Ahmedabad, Gujarat**, a city that inspires me with its blend of tradition and innovation. Growing up here has instilled in me a love for simplicity, timeless design, and old-school values—all of which reflect in the apps and digital products I aspire to build, especially those that focus on intuitive interfaces that feel both modern and familiar.
