When I joined the tech industry in 2022 as a trainee, I honestly had no idea what I was walking into.

I didn’t know what the **IT domain** really entailed.

I didn’t know:

- What an **API** was
- What a **database** did
- Why everyone used **Postman**
- Or even the difference between **GET** and **POST** requests

But I knew one thing: **I wanted to understand how software actually ships**—from development to production, from the code editor to the real user.

This is the story of how the **Pygmalion Effect**—the psychological phenomenon where higher expectations lead to increased performance—quietly shaped my journey from a mobile intern to a backend developer working with Node.js, databases, and AWS.

## What is the Pygmalion Effect?

Before I dive into the code, here is the concept in simple terms.

The **Pygmalion Effect** suggests that when people expect more from you (or when you expect more from yourself), you naturally rise to meet those standards.

It works in two ways:

1.  **External expectations:** What your mentors, team, or manager believe you can do.
2.  **Internal expectations (The Galatea Effect):** What you keep telling yourself you are capable of.

In my case, both were present from day one—long before I knew there was a name for it.

## 2022: The 45-Minute Interview That Changed Everything

When I interviewed for the **Mobile Application Developer** intern role, something unusual happened.

The interview lasted **45 minutes**.

For a trainee role, that is rare. Usually, it’s a quick check of basics and a chat with HR. But this team spent time evaluating me. That interaction did two things:

1.  It made me feel they took me seriously.
2.  It forced me to set a higher standard for myself: _"If they are investing this much time, I have to be worth it."_

I didn’t know backend. I didn’t know APIs.

What I did have was some **UI work** I had done earlier, and a stubborn belief that I could become the best at mobile development. I almost "manifested" it:

> _"I am the best at mobile application development. I don't know the rest yet, but I will figure it out."_

That belief wasn't backed by deep technical knowledge yet. It was backed by **attitude**. Looking back, that was my personal Pygmalion effect starting in the background.

## Falling in Love with the "Black Box"

Once I joined, reality hit. I started seeing the ecosystem behind the screen:

- How the **frontend** talks to the **backend**.
- How **APIs** carry data.
- How **deployments**, **logs**, and **release cycles** actually work.

I realized that a working app isn't just one dev writing code; it is a symphony of design, logic, infrastructure, and QA. This curiosity pulled me away from just building screens and toward the logic that powers them.

## The Pivot: Thrown into Backend (Node.js)

Within three months, I transitioned to a **Backend Developer** role in **Node.js**.

Again, I was a beginner. I didn't fully grasp what "backend" meant other than "the thing that sends JSON." For the first time, I encountered terms like **Server**, **Schema**, **Relations**, and **Queries**.

I had no idea how data was structured or why schema design mattered. But again, my mindset was simple:

> _"I can do this. I will understand it."_

My surroundings played a huge role. The team didn't treat me like "just an intern"—they treated me like a developer who simply hadn't learned _yet_.

- People trusted me with tasks.
- I stopped taking myself lightly.
- I dove into **SQL** and **NoSQL**.

My mental image of the backend shifted from a "mysterious black box" to a "system I can reason about."

## Level Up: AWS and The 500MB Challenge

The real test of this mindset came when I hit a wall with file storage. I learned that databases store text, but they aren't meant for heavy files like videos.

_So, where do the files go?_

That question led me to **AWS** and **S3 Buckets**. The chain reaction was immediate: S3 led to EC2, which led to RDS and Lambda. Once again, I was dropped into the deep end.

### The Problem

We needed to upload **500 MB video files** to our bucket. The standard flow—sending the file to the server first, then to S3—was failing. The request payload was too heavy for the server to handle efficiently.

### The Solution

We discussed it internally. The team looked at me and said, _"Maybe Anand can crack this."_

That was the **Expectation**.

I could have said, "I don't know how." Instead, I said: **"Sure. I'll figure it out."**

I researched extensively and implemented **S3 Pre-Signed URLs**:

1.  The server generates a secure, time-limited URL.
2.  The client uploads the file _directly_ to AWS, bypassing our server bottleneck.

This was a new concept for the office at the time. Implementing it independently was a turning point. I wasn't trying to prove I was a genius; I was proving that my **attitude** made me someone the team could trust with the unknown.

## The Compound Effect

That success unlocked more opportunities:

- Video compression on the server.
- Image optimization pipelines.
- Media manipulation with **FFmpeg**.

The pattern kept repeating: **People expected more → I rose to meet it. → I expected more from myself → I grew into it.**

By the time I hit my two-year mark, I realized that "years of experience" matters less than "years of curiosity." I could have spent two years just closing tickets. Instead, I spent two years saying "Yes" to things I didn't know how to do yet.

## Looking Back

Writing this now, over three years since that first day, I am still doing the same thing. Whether it is learning **Spring Boot**, moving to **Java**, or exploring **GenAI**, the formula remains the same.

The Pygmalion Effect isn't magic. It's a feedback loop.

1.  **Believe you are capable.**
2.  **Surround yourself with people who believe you are capable.**
3.  **The skills will follow the belief.**

_Have you ever accepted a technical challenge before you knew how to solve it? I’d love to hear your "Pygmalion" moment._
